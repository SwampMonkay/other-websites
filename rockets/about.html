			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p class="article__description">
				By Rocket Staff Member

			<h3>What do we do?</h3><br />
			<p>
				Rockets is an organization that focuses on studying nature and finding out as 
				much as we can about nature in the Swamps. We have sheets of paper, and you collect 
				small samples of things you find in the Swamps. Once we have samples, we tape them on 
				the paper and write as much as we can about them (like questions, facts, and 
				hypotheses). We then put our paper in a binder under the correct section.
			</p><br />
			<h3>Meetings:</h3><br />
			<p>
				During our meetings, we get out the binder and each take turns sharing the papers we 
				put in there. As we share, members give each other advice and compliments. After 
				that, we put the binder away and talk about future plans. Meetings are held under 
				Juliet’s sunroom, and we will tell you when a meeting is coming up.
			</p><br />
			<h3>Founders:</h3><br />
			<h5>Juliet-</h5>
			<p>
				<p>--> She has made the most papers in our group</p>
				<p>--> She had the idea to start a club</p>
				<p>--> It was her idea to do something nature related</p>
				<p>--> She collected most of our samples</p>
			</p><br />
			<h5>Ella-</h5>
			<p>
				<p>--> She had the idea to study nature</p>
				<p>--> The binder was her idea to do</p>
				<p>--> She has supplied most of our facts</p>
				<p>--> She is the organizer</p>
			</p><br />
			<h3>What can I do?</h3><br />
			<p>
				If you join our club, you can collect samples as one of your first jobs.You can also 
				contribute to the decorations in our area if you want. Once we think you are ready 
				(which will be pretty quickly) you will start to make papers of your own and you will get 
				a section in the binder. You will be trusted to do your own thing, but don’t be in the 
				area while Juliet is not around.
